# nginx-reverse-proxy

## Using

This docker image takes 2 optional arguments:
- REMOTE_HOST
-- This defaults to 'localhost' if unprovided
- REMOTE_PORT
-- This defaults to '8993' if unprovided

### NOTE:
After running the container following the example below, you will want to check what port got assigned to your machine for PAT to occur (`docker ps -a`).
Otherwise, you can statically define this by using the argument `-p 8443:8443` instead of including `-P` for automatic PAT assignments.

### Example:

```
~
matthew.bates@LinkMJB🍺 $ docker run -e REMOTE_HOST=google.com -e REMOTE_PORT=443 -itP nginx-reverse-proxy:latest
